# Tht_Cellular_Distribution_ImagesAndModel
Material associated with the ThT study dynamics. These files include (1) fluorescent time-lapse images of HeLa cells incubated with ThT and/or TMRM, and (2) a simple model describing the membrane-potential dependent distribution of a cationic dye and subsequent binding of the dye in the cell.
